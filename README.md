Hi, Mina Girgis
I’m interested in coding and soccer
I’m currently learning programing
I'm originally from Egypt
I'm a Junior in Computer Engineering
I chose my major because I felt that it is the way to go for the future
A fun fact about me is: I like to watch indian movies.
What do I want to learn from EE 205? I want to be Professional Engineer
A book or movie I'd recommend is: Baaghi
